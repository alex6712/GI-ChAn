## Target

Create a platform where users can save builds of their
characters and with the help of a smart system to improve them.

Users will be able to upload their characters to the web application.

This can be done both manually or with 
[**Enka.Network**](https://enka.network)
in the future.

Along with the characters, it will be possible to download artifacts, 
which in the future will allow you to customize character builds 
and improve them.
